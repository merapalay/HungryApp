# HungryApp
Hungry App should let you search for and discover restaurants to eat out at or order from. The app lets user to browse through 
restaurant menus to decide where one wants to eat. A restaurant is identified by name as well as address which can be treated 
as a unique key. A user is identified by either User Id or Phone No. The food-delivery agent is identified by his agent-id or 
his phone number.

Right now, we will like to develop the App not as a mobile app but just as a desktop application. To develop the application, 
maintain the following lists 


1. Restaurant List - List of restaurants with details like address/area, no-of-seats, special facilities, menu etc,

2. Agents-List- Each agent identified by agent-id, name, phone No., currently-accumulated- commission etc. 

3. User-List, each user identified by user-id, name, address, phone no, etc. For every user, alist of all previous orders is also kept.
